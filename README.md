# CodeWars
This repository consists of my Python solutions to some *Codewars* challenges (otherwise known as 'Katas').
The challenges are of varying difficulty: 8kyu being the easiest and 1kyu being the hardest.
The purpose of these mini challenges is to practice your coding and apply the skills that you have learnt.

Note that files that are not labelled (for example 6kyu) have an unknown kyu level.
